Another clicker game experimentation using react.

Project was used to further improve my react writing. With the addition of framer motion to more easily create less buggy and cleaner animated images. Learned more about the lifecycle of components and how timers/intervals also affect how react manages the dom.

Next Project will focus more on using Tailwind and maybe some backend stuff we will see...
